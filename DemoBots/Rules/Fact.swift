//  Abstract:
//  This file introduces the rules used by the `TaskBot` rule system to determine an appropriate action for the `TaskBot`. The rules fall into  three            distinct sets:
//              Percentage of bad `TaskBot`s in the level (low, medium, high):
//                  `BadTaskBotPercentageLowRule`
//                  `BadTaskBotPercentageMediumRule`
//                  `BadTaskBotPercentageHighRule`
//              How close the `TaskBot` is to the `PlayerBot` (near, medium, far):
//                  `PlayerBotNearRule`
//                  `PlayerBotMediumRule`
//                  `PlayerBotFarRule`
//              How close the `TaskBot` is to its nearest "good" `TaskBot` (near, medium, far):
//                  `TaskBotNearRule`
//                  `TaskBotMediumRule`
//                  `TaskBotFarRule`
//
